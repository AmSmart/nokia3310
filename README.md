# nokia3310 - import gmail contacts to new Nokia 3310

Because vcf222 from https://dba.ovh/vcf222.html didn't work for me and I didn't find sources to fix it, I wrote this small tool. 
Usage:
- import contacts from gmail via More->Export->vCard format
- execute this tool giving vcf file name as argument
- put created backup.dat file into Backup folder of your phone. 
- on Nokia 3310 call Menu->Settings->Backup->RestoreBackup->Contacts
